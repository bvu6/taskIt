**Sprint 1:**
* Provide insights for what you all saw the customer do with the project:
  - Customer first pressed the login button without any username or password inputs to test
  - On the task page, he went around pressing buttons expecting something to pop up
  - Customer put in invalid date (which is something we will work on)
  - Priority buttons still not fully functioning yet

* Feedback from Customer:
  - Implement a Dark Mode option eventually
  - For the "Create New Task", try implementing a dropdown box for the priority
  - Add a task overview on the side 
  - Highlight box when clicked
  - Connect all the panes to have it all flow together
  - Check for invalid input from user during the login screen
  - Input an error message if login is not correct

**Sprint 2:**
* Provide insights for what you all saw the customer do with the project:
 - Clicked on all the tabs and buttons
 - Changed the task creation date 
 - The user didn't update 

* Feedback from Customer:
- Change the buttons to correspond to the light modes
- Change the right side pane to match the left side
- Don't update the date of task creation when editing 

**Sprint 3:**
* Provide insights for what you all saw the customer do with the project:
 - The create task page would still have the information from the last entry
 - The calendar stops working (Unknonwn reason/Was not able to replicate the actions that caused the errors)

* Feedback from Customer:
- Have the create task page correspond to the light/dark modes
- Have the drop down box also correspond to the light/dark modes (Consistant theme layout)
