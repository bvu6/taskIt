**Sprint 1:**
* Provide insights for what you all saw the customer do with the project:
  - Customer first pressed the login button without any username or password inputs to test
  - On the task page, he went around pressing buttons expecting something to pop up
  - Customer put in invalid date (which is something we will work on)
  - Priority buttons still not fully functioning yet

* Feedback from Customer:
  - Implement a Dark Mode option eventually
  - For the "Create New Task", try implementing a dropdown box for the priority
  - Add a task overview on the side 
  - Highlight box when clicked
  - Connect all the panes to have it all flow together
  - Check for invalid input from user during the login screen
  - Input an error message if login is not correct
