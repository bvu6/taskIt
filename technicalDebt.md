**How we would deal with Technical Debt:**

- Prioritize what couldn’t be done during the last sprint regarding any improper system design/architecture or incomplete user stories in the code for the next upcoming sprint. By doing so we don’t end up accumulating poor practices which would be harder to implement/fix later on. 

**Additional tools:**

- Gradle (Dependency management)
- Github actions/pull requests (Continuous integration)
- Color contrast checker (Visual appeal)

**Processes/Engineering practices:**

- Keeping a consistent naming convention for variables
- Continue to follow the scrum process 
- Set up meetings twice a week to update each other on the progress of our work and see what else needs to be accomplished
- Create unit tests 
- Create a task board for user stories and measure it’s complexity
- Frequently committing 
- Utilize effective commenting practices
- Prioritize certain user stories to meet certain deadlines or requirements
